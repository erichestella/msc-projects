            <p>Nayeon (Korean: 나연), born September 22, 1995, is a Korean singer-songwriter. Her real name is Im Na Yeon. She is the oldest member, lead singer and face of the girl group Twice. She grew up in Seoul, South Korea, where she lived with her parents and little sister Im Seo Yeon.

                As a child, she took part in a children's modeling competition. There she was discovered by JYP Entertainment and asked as a trainee. Her mother refused at the time, but 10 years later, in 2010, she secretly attended JYP's open casting and was accepted. Nayeon was selected for JYP's girl group 6mix, but the group never debuted. On May 5, 2015, she participated in JYP's survival show “SIXTEEN”. She made it to second place and became a member of the girl group TWICE. </p>
